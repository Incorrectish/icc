Binary operations, some should be in %rcx instead of rbx, in the case where the
right expression is a nested expression, it overwrited rbx -> bad

Function calls aren't evaluating the parameters in the right order?
fix this 

in addition this evaluates to 0??? fix also
int a = sum(1, 2) - (sum(1, 2) / 2) * 2;
